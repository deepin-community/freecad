Description: Extensible Open Source CAx program
 For 3D printing, CNC milling or for the manual assembly of complicated
 constructs one needs a formal specification of the workpiece, i.e.,
 its parts and how these come together. The process to get there is
 called Computer-Aided Design (CAD). The process to transform a CAD
 model into a series of instructions that can be performed on a machine
 is called Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). FreeCAD can do both, the
 prior yet a bit better than the latter.
 .
 FreeCAD is an Open Source CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python.
 It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability
 to run as a server and dynamically loadable application extensions and
 it is designed to be platform independent.
 .
 Currently, FreeCAD can import and display CAD models in IGES, STEP, and
 BRep formats and meshes in STL, BMS, AST and Wavefront OBJ formats.
 Editing and modeling features are currently somewhat limited.
 .
 This is a metapackage of FreeCAD component packages.
